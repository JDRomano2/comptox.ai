About ComptoxAI
===============

ComptoxAI is a toolkit designed to enable AI and data science research in
computational toxicology. Like many areas in biomedicine, environmental
toxicology is facing a deluge of valuable data being generated in a wide array
of modalities and levels of biological organization. However, the tools for
interacting with these data are - at best - inconsistent, outdated, and fail to
leverage state-of-the-art computational methods.

We're creating ComptoxAI in order to change this.

Authors
-------

ComptoxAI is developed and maintained by Joseph D. Romano, who is currently a
postdoctoral researcher at the University of Pennsylvania in the Computational
Genetics Lab.

Citing ComptoxAI
----------------

ComptoxAI is still under development, but we will update this page with a
preprint citation when we have one written. In the meantime, please contact us
if you would like to use ComptoxAI for research purposes (you don't need our
permission, we'd just like to make sure you're aware of which work is evaluated
and which isn't at this point)!

Funding and Acknowledgements
----------------------------

ComptoxAI is supported by grant funding from the US National Institutes of
Health, including R01-LM010098 (PI: Moore), R01-LM012601 (PI: Moore), and
