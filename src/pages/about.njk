    <b>Computational toxicology</b> is the branch of toxicology that uses
    computational modeling to predict toxic interactions in biological systems
    and explain mechanisms of interactions that are already known.
  </div>

  <section>
    <p>ComptoxAI is a toolkit designed to enable AI and data science research in computational toxicology. Like many disciplines in biomedicine, computational toxicology is experiencing a deluge of valuable data being generated in a wide array of modalities and levels of application. However, the tools for interacting with these data are - at best - inconsistent, outdated, and fail to leverage state-of-the-art computational methods. We intend for ComptoxAI to change this.</p>

  <h2>Main components of ComptoxAI</h2>

  <h4>Toxicology graph database</h4>
  <p>
    ComptoxAIâ€™s graph database is meant to completely replace traditional
    relational databases used for computational toxicology data. Rather than
    storing data in tables - with keys linking rows of one table to rows of
    another - a graph database stores entities as nodes and the relationships
    that join entities as edges, resulting in a network-like data structure
    known to computer scientists as a graph.
  </p>

  <h4>Graph database algorithms</h4>
  <p>
    One of the key advantages of representing data as a graph is that it makes
    it almost trivial to implement algorithms that highlight important
    characteristics in networks. These include:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Shortest path finding between two nodes</li>
    <li>Community detection</li>
    <li>Page rank; for identifying the most influential nodes (made famous by Google)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    All of these are (or soon will be) implemented natively in ComptoxAI, and
    can be as simple as running a single line of Python code.
  </p>

  <h4>ComptoxAI's ontology</h4>
  <p>
    An ontology is a certain type of <i>knowledge representation</i> that makes
    it possible to define concepts in a way that enables <i>automated
    reasoning</i> (i.e., in a way that computers can "understand"). It does this
    by linking objects arranged in a hierarchy via descriptive non-hierarchical
    relationships. Ontologies are a crucial component of modern artificial
    intelligence ecosystems, and nicely complement "knowledge-free" AI methods,
    like statistical computing and machine learning.
  </p>
  <p>
    ComptoxAI includes a complete ontology that gives explicit restrictions to
    the data stored in the graph database.

    <p>
      ComptoxAI is supported by grant funding from the US National Institutes of
      Health, including R01-LM010098 (PI: Moore), R01-LM012601 (PI: Moore), and
      T32-ES019851 (PI: Penning).
